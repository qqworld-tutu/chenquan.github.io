I'm a sophomore from School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. I am also studying a double degree in Computer Science at the School of EECS.



My research interests and skills are concentrated in the fields of Machine Learning and Statistics. I currently do not have a supervisor or research group.



I'm also a member of the Student Union of School of Mathematical Sciences. I'm currently the *Minister of Outreach Department*. Everyone is welcome to join in the various activities of SMS Student Union.



The website is still under construction. Codes and course notes are uploading quickly.
